So they sent another check. It was over a $1000 short. Again, they showed my brothers acreage on the check stub. Finally they said they would have their examiner recheck. So this week, I got the final check. It has took from June 2025 to September 15, 2025, to get the full amount due. I would never lease with again. Just beware, if you lease with them, It will take about 45 days before you will receive a check. Always check the check stub that shows the amount of acreage. I suggested they fire their examiner."

I negotiated for them to also lease our interests in 12-24W-15N for the same bonus/percentage. Hard to know, but there is renewed interest in that area.

A recent lease example from Southwestern Production (now Expand Energy) comes up and you can peruse the language. Pay particular attention to the Exhibit B and Addendum language in the later pages. This language modifies the boilerplate language in the lease. Things like royalty percentage, storage rights, no cost, hold harmless etc. That said do you know what company is proposing the lease? You need to confirm the net acres you own which the landman can supply. If it is the 12.5 you mentioned you should not settle for less than $4,000 per acre bonus and try to get $4,500 per.

We have mineral interest in Oklahoma so I have no knowledge of the situation in ND. But in our experience, the first offer and even beyond tend to be lowball and you should not be timid about entering into a negotiation. I have doubled and in one case tripled the initial offer. I think your percentage 18% correlates to a 3/16 royalty. I just closed a lease on one parcel by negotiating a lower lease bonus and a better percentage (20% or 1/5). This forum is a great place to become more knowledgeable about how all this works. One more thing. If you and your other family members can negotiate as a bloc, you will have more leverage, even if you each sign an individual lease for your respective interests. I wish you the best."

I currently lease the rights to a company that pays me about $3,000 for every 3 years. El Dorado Mineral Partners has been quick to make this offer. I’ve not ever had an offer to purchase the rights, just a lot of offers to lease it. I have always stayed with McDonald Land/Chesapeake. My 5.3 acres is part of a 360 family plot and my understanding is that everyone else sold their rights a long time ago. I inherited this from my mother in law, who inherited it from her aunt so it’s been in the family for around 50 years. So, this sounds great to have some money in my pocket, but I’m figuring after I pay taxes and such it really isn’t much at all and then I lose out on the possibility of any royalties (although they haven’t found anything in all these years).

We received a call from a company wanting to lease mineral rights that we didn’t realize my wife had. Seems that this goes back generations ago, and my wife is one of maybe 10 relatives that are co-owners of a 164 acre tract in Lea County NM.
Township 25S, Section 10, Range 36E. The attorney that called said she owns an undivided interest.
Supposedly the other family members had already been contacted, and they had negotiated a lease for $1000 per acre with 20% royalty.
We are supposed to receive the contract today or tomorrow.
Is this a fair offer? We really don’t know what to expect.

Potentially this could yield a very large return. There are many particulars we could discuss such as royalty rates 18%, bonus amounts per net acre $4,500 to $5,000 and a no cost clause in a lease.

I’ve learned a lot on this site before posting this but I still have questions. Should I be trying to find the landman for other companies and seeing what they’ll offer (and how do I get that info?) or just negotiate with Antero for a better deal?
Also, it seems there was a lot of talk and interest in WV back in 2018. I see in old posts the offers were much higher. Should I be going off those numbers or not as this is new drilling?"

You need to find out how many of the 13 mineral acres are yours or what is called net acres. You can contact the landman from Antero who should know this figure. Based on that I would counter the offer with $4,000 per net acre and 18% no cost royalty. They always lowball their first offer. Nat gas is on the rise right now. A good time to negotiate. It is normal to be one of many individuals party to a portion of the total 13 mineral acres. Once you find out your net acres multiply that by the bonus amount offered per net acre. The royalty percentage is more important so go for a higher number there which once they drill will pay for a much longer period. Others may have better input as my interests are in Marshall Co. Check out the Tyler Co website for lease examples atIDX Search Tyler County. Good luck."

Regarding your mineral ownership, I would suspect that you own a very small percentage of that 13 acres. The reason I believe this is Antero has historically offered $3,000 per net mineral acre for a signing bonus. Their flat fee for anything below 1/10th of an acre is $300. 15% isn’t bad, but isn’t great either. They are likely offering this as a “final offer” before it gets drilled, but the way it works is that if you refuse to sign a lease, they have to pay you the same royalty rate as the highest negotiated lease in that tract. So if someone else negotiated 18% without deductions like@domesaid to ask for, that is what you will be paid."

The $4,500 per net acre offer is very good. That is the one time bonus that you receive for signing the lease. Do you know how many net acres of the 190 your father owns? Are there other owners/relatives with a share of the 190 acres. The landman should be able to tell you how many net acres you own. Multiply the net acres times the $4,500 rate and that is the bonus you should receive. The 18% royalty rate is also very good once they drill and go into production. Try to get a no cost clause included so they can’t charge you for transportation, compression, gathering, marketing etc after the gas is recovered. Also a depth clause should be considered to limit to just the Marcellus level. If you have a large portion of the 190 acres it may be wise to consult an oil & gas attorney. Good luck."

We were sent a 5yr contract for leasing the mineral rights to Permian Resources and I have no idea what that means or what i would be signing. The contract states we (the great grand children) are entitled to 3/16th royalties. Any help sorting this out would be greatly appreciated."

Now that I am more familiar with the industry, I feel like we are better off with the 3 year as opposed to the 5 year.  On a 3 year, the energy company has more incentive to drill sooner than later.  On a 5 year deal, the drillers can hold off on mine while they drill on someone else’s rights that has an earlier expiration date.  Since we live 1,000 miles away, and don’t have property tax (we own minerals only, not the surface), it is just an unexpected blessing for us.  If/when they drill and hit, it will be “manna from heaven.”  I suggest you go with the 3 year lease."

I should have started with I own 100% of the minerals. Although there are producing formations in this county as well as coal and lignite I would forgo development 35 years if the terms were financially adequate.
From what I have read in this forum there is a wide range of dollar amount per acre for mineral rights. Ala kingfisher county Texas 400.00 an acre for 35 year commitment. I am sure there are cases were the surface and mineral owners were treated the same.
Your are correct in recommending a solar attorney. Unfortunately the ones I have researched to date want a percentage of deal as opposed to an hourly fee.

You are in an excellent position if you own all of the minerals.  I own a 1/8 of the minerals in about 2000 acres, and a company wants a mineral accommodation agreement.  They have agreed to minimal drill site locations.  However, I’m not sure if this would be sufficient.   Also, it’s doubtful that a 3D Seismic survey could be performed.  There has been excellent production on the property in the last 20 years but no leasing activity during the last ten years.  An attorney tells me that if they secure half or more of the minerals, they can proceed, so I am not in as good of a position as you are.  As far as what they will pay, they started at $50.00 an acre and are now at $700.  Although unconfirmed, I understand that the surface owner, who also owns an undivided interest in the minerals, will potentially receive millions annually when fully developed.  I hope this helps.

Matrix is drilling 4 new units bordering you place on the west as we speak…and EOG has committed 5 billion to this area alone…they are starting on the south play by US90A hallettsville-Shiner road, and another 1288 acre unit on the north end of their play close to moravia/Br"

Seems really low to us as we have been getting 20% royalty on other minerals and other ND folks I know have been at that 20% royalty rate for that last 5 years or so - any thoughts or recent activity info?  Much appreciated.    Great to see some new lease activity in Divide County!"

If you sign the lease and get a $10,500 bonus check, it means they have determined you own 1/16 of the 240 acres, or 15 acres. There is no way of knowing what the oil company is planning. If by some chance your minerals have a Residual Oil Zone which they are intending to produce, or might be produced by someone else in the future, an oil and gas attorney is needed, imo."
