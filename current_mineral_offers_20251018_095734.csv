It isn’t that one well was cut in half, or two, or three…
I had thought, at first, that Exxon might be cleaning out the wells. Then maybe that Exxon was re-drilling, then that it was combining them horizontally. Does anyone on here know, who wants to share the info?

The Nabors B23 has already drilled and last week it was being packed up off the well pad. I live only a few hours away (5 hrs) and can drive over there and have eye’s on the situation.
We had one company that wanted to buy our minerals (even at this late date of active drilling) and they are the ones that confirmed that there will be 4 wells.

Just curious as my relatives have received a few calls/letters wanting to buy or lease in these areas recently. One offer to buy in 14N-21W went from initial $1200/acre to over $3000/acre within six weeks. Would like to hear anyone’s experience with recent leasing or purchase offers in Roger Mills County."

We recieved an offer to purchase  at 3,000 per mineral acre. We wojld consider selling since it is small ( 13 acres ) and would have to be devided among several heirs which I think would make it to small for leasing purposes. Any thoughts on selling now or is Caddo a promising area since we are receiving occasional offers?"
